                        1. Base your meals on higher fiber starchy carbohydrates
                    </p>
                    <p class="description_tips">
                        Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of your food. They
                        include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta, and cereals. Choose higher fiber or
                        wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice, or potatoes with
                        their skins on. They contain more fiber than white or refined starchy
                        carbohydrates and can help you feel full longer. Try to include at least 1
                        starchy food with each main meal. <br /><br />

                        Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram the
                        carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat. Keep
                        an eye on the fats you add when cooking or serving these foods because
                        that's what increases the calorie content â€“ for example, oil on chips,
                        butter on bread, and creamy sauces on pasta.
                    </p>

                    <p class="headline_tips">2. Eat lots of fruit and veg</p>
                    <p class="description_tips">
                        It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and
                        veg every day. They can be: fresh, frozen, canned, dried, juiced. Getting
                        your 5 A Day is easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your
                        breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh
                        fruit? A portion of fresh, canned, or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A
                        portion of dried fruit (which should be kept for mealtimes) is 30g. A 150ml
                        glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice, or smoothie also counts as 1 portion,
                        but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks
                        are sugary and can damage your teeth.
                    </p>

                    <p class="headline_tips">3. Eat more fish, including a portion of oily fish</p>
                    <p class="description_tips">
                        Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals.
                        Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including at least 1 portion
                        of oily fish. Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent
                        heart disease. Oily fish include: salmon trout herring sardines pilchards
                        mackerel Non-oily fish include: haddock plaice coley cod tuna skate hake You
                        can choose from fresh, frozen, and canned, but remember that canned and
                        smoked fish can be high in salt. Most people should be eating more fish, but
                        there are recommended limits for some types of fish.
                    </p>

                    <p class="headline_tips">4. Cut down on saturated fat and sugar</p>
                    <p class="description_tips">
                        Saturated fat You need some fat in your diet, but it's important to pay
                        attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating. There are 2 main
                        types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much-saturated fat can increase
                        the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of
                        developing heart disease. On average, men should have no more than 30g of
                        saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of
                        saturated fat a day. <br /><br />
                        Children under the age of 11 should have less saturated fat than adults, but
                        a low-fat diet is not suitable for children under 5. Saturated fat is found
                        in many foods, such as fatty cuts of meat sausages butter hard cheese cream
                        cakes biscuits lard pies Try to eat less saturated fat and choose foods that
                        contain unsaturated fats instead, such as vegetable oils and spreads, oily
                        fish, and avocados. For a healthier choice, use a small amount of vegetable
                        or olive oil, or reduced-fat spread instead of butter, lard, or ghee. When
                        you're having meat, choose lean cuts and cut off any visible fat. All types
                        of fat are high in energy, so they should only be eaten in small amounts.
                    </p>

                    <p class="headline_tips">5. Eat less salt</p>
                    <p class="description_tips">
                        No more than 6g a day for adults Eating too much salt can raise your blood
                        pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart
                        disease or have a stroke. Even if you do not add salt to your food, you may
                        still be eating too much. About three-quarters of the salt you eat is
                        already in the food when you buy it, such as breakfast cereals, soups,
                        bread, and sauces. Use food labels to help you cut down. More than 1.5g of
                        salt per 100g means the food is high in salt. Adults and children aged 11
                        and over should eat no more than 6g of salt (about a teaspoonful) a day.
                        Younger children should have even less.
                    </p>

                    <p class="headline_tips">6. Get active and be a healthy weight</p>
                    <p class="description_tips">
                        As well as eating healthily, regular exercise may help reduce your risk of
                        getting serious health conditions. It's also important for your overall
                        health and wellbeing. Read more about the benefits of exercise and physical
                        activity guidelines for adults. Being overweight or obese can lead to health
                        conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, heart disease and
                        stroke. Being underweight could also affect your health. Most adults need to
                        lose weight by eating fewer calories. If you're trying to lose weight, aim
                        to eat less and be more active. Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help you
                        maintain a healthy weight. Check whether you're a healthy weight by using
                        the BMI healthy weight calculator. Lose weight with the NHS weight loss
                        plan, a 12-week weight loss guide that combines advice on healthier eating
                        and physical activity. If you're underweight, see underweight adults. If
                        you're worried about your weight, ask your GP or a dietitian for advice.
                    </p>

                    <p class="headline_tips">7. Do not get thirsty</p>
                    <p class="description_tips">
                        You need to drink plenty of fluids to stop you from getting dehydrated. The
                        government recommends drinking 6 to 8 glasses every day. This is in addition
                        to the fluid you get from the food you eat. All non-alcoholic drinks count,
                        but water, lower-fat milk, and lower-sugar drinks, including tea and coffee,
                        are healthier choices. Try to avoid sugary soft and fizzy drinks, as they're
                        high in calories. They're also bad for your teeth. Even unsweetened fruit
                        juice and smoothies are high in free sugar. Your combined total of drinks
                        from fruit juice, vegetable juice, and smoothies should not be more than
                        150ml a day, which is a small glass. Remember to drink more fluids during
                        hot weather or while exercising.
                    </p>

                    <p class="headline_tips">8. Do not skip breakfast</p>
                    <p class="description_tips">
                        Some people skip breakfast because they think it'll help them lose weight.
                        But a healthy breakfast high in fiber and low in fat, sugar, and salt can
                        form part of a balanced diet and can help you get the nutrients you need for
                        good health. Wholegrain lower-sugar cereal with semi-skimmed milk and fruit
                        sliced over the top is a tasty and healthier breakfast.
